# Data Structures in Python

This project is designed to practice and showcase my understanding of data structures in Python. It includes implementations of various data structures along with unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.

## Current Progress

### LinkedList
I have implemented a `LinkedList` class with the following functionalities:
- **Add**: Adds element to end of the list.
- **Insert**: Add a new element to the list. If the index is not valid, it will add the element to the beginning or end depending on the index.
- **Delete**: Remove an element from the list.
- **Search**: Returns true if an element is in the list.
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the list.
- **Combine**: Join two linked lists into one.

## Testing
All functionalities are thoroughly tested using Python's `unittest` framework to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Future Plans
I plan to implement additional data structures such as:
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to expand this project!

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the tests using:
    ```bash
    python3 -m unittest discover
    ```
